There are two command line arguments you can use to set JVM heap sizes: -Xms and -Xmx.

From what I found, it appears you can add a system environment variable named _JAVA_OPTIONS
(under Windows), and set the heap size values there. For example, if you want a 512Mb
initial (Xms) and 1024Mb maximum (Xmx) heap size you could use:

SET _JAVA_OPTIONS = -Xms512m -Xmx1024m

I couldn't find for sure how to do this programatically, but reading through the Runtime
javadoc it seems like the Runtime.exec() method enables command line input.
(http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#exec(java.lang.String))

So perhaps it would look something like this:

    Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd.exe /c java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m")

But that goes into something called processes which I don't understand, and I'm not going
down that rabbit hole right now.

There's also some stuff about setting the young heap and old heap, but I'm also not going
to delve into that right yet either.
