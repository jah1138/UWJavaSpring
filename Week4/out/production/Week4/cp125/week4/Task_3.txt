Task 3

Q:

What can you say about the Properties class's ability to preserve the order of
entries in the source text file? Compare the order of entries on disk and when
printed out in your program.

A:

I hadn't read ahead in the assignment so I didn't know to expect the reordering.
When I first ran BuddyProperties I immediately saw they were different and I
thought for a moment I'd done something wrong.

The Properties class obviously doesn't make a point of retaining the entry order
of the config file. I can see why it wouldn't really matter: first of all, a
hash table or hash map is designed for retrieving individual values by referencing
a key, so it's irrelevant whether the values are stored in a content-based sequence.
If it's important to have an ordered dataset, the original program should address
that by either sorting the data after loading it, or by using structures that
preserve order.

I read through the source code of Properties.load(InputStream inStream) to see
whether that might have some impact on the data order, but there's some pretty
arcane stuff going on in that method. I doubt it anyway, because it's processing
the data in sequence as read directly from the stream. I'm guessing it's just
hash table behavior.
