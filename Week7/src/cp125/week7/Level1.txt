Level 1

The error is happening when the book is being added to the ArrayList. To help figure out what might be happening I
looked at the ArrayList code. I saw that the exception happened at the line "elementData[size++] = e;".

That line adds the element to the array, and somehow size++ ends up referring to a nonexistent index. Let’s look at
the line before the add also:

ensureCapacityInternal(size + 1);
elementData[size++] = e;

The first line checks the array to see if there’s room for one more element. If so, it returns and the element is
added to the next index. If the end of the available indexes has been reached, it increases the size of the list to
add more indexes, and then returns control to the add method.

Imagine that our thread clears the capacity check, but then is stopped by the JVM before adding the element to the
next index. While it’s stopped, other objects are added that actually DO fill up the list to capacity. When our
thread is restarted, it will execute the next line of code and try to add the element to the index at size++, which
now is an index that doesn’t exist. Index out of bounds!
